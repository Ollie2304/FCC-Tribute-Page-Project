            Sir William Drummond Macdonald Paton was a British pharmacologist who was <br>born 5<sup>th</sup>
            May 1917 and died 17<sup>th</sup> October 1993. 
            And he was awarded three awards during his time as a pharmacologist:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh (1956)</li>
                    <li>Gairdner Foundation International Award (1959)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            </div>
         <div id="info2">
            <p>
            Paton discovered two new classes of drugs which acted on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors<br>
            which layed down the foundation for the development of:
                <ul>
                 <li>Decamethonium which was the first neuromuscular blocking drug that was specific.</li>   
                <li>Hexamethonium which was the first drug to specifically and safely lower blood pressure.</li>        
                 </ul>
             </p>
            </div>
            <div id="info3">
                <p>
                    Another achievement was the discovery of preventing convulsions and sickness that was
                    associated with deep-sea diving. This was done by adding nitrogen to the mixture of 
                    oxygen and helium that the divers used. This caused it to become anaesthetic 
                    at high pressures needed for deep sea dives. As a result of this divers could now 
                    dive to depths greater than before.
