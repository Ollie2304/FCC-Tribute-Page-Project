            Sir William Drummond Macdonald Paton was a British pharmacologist who was born 5<sup>th</sup>
            May 1917 and died 17<sup>th</sup> October 1993. 
            <br> And he was awarded three awards during his time as a pharmacologist:
            <ul>
                <li>Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh (1956)</li>
                <li>Gairdner Foundation International Award (1959)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Paton discovered two new classes of drugs which acted on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which 
            layed down the foundation for the development of Decamethonium which was the first neuromuscular blocking
            drug that was specific. In addition, this discovery also helped develop Hexamethonium which was the first
            drug to specifically and safely lower blood pressure.
